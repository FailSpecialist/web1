    <h2>JavaScript</h2>

    <P>
        A programming language that can be written on HTML!
        <br>
        Q. Why do browsers only understand Javascript? Can you write Python and Java in HTML?
        <br>
        A. It's not impossible. However, because this is a "historical reason & already made standard", 
        <br>
        All browsers are designed to understand Javascript by default.
        <br>
        Every web server is supposed to give HTML+CSS+Javascript as response data.
        <br>
        Q. What is the difference between Java and Javascript?
        <br>
        A. India and Indonesia, It doesn't have anything to do with anything like that.
